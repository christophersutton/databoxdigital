There's a lot to learn from the study of human behavior. Fields like psychology, sociology and behavioral economics have given us volumes of research that shed light on how we make decisions and what guides our behavior. Much of this research can be directly applied to our design processes to help build experiences that people will love.

I shared some of this research recently during a talk at [WebVisions PDX](www.webvisionsevent.com/portland/). I outlined eight studies on human behavior and practical applications for incorpororating the underlying principles into your design process. The video of the talk should be coming in the next few weeks, but here are the slides in the meantime.
