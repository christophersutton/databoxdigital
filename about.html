	<h3>The Basics</h3>
	<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Chris Sutton</strong>. I'm a software product manager and business strategist. I specialize in product optimization using a blend of customer analytics and customer psychology. </p>

	<p>By day I'm working with the fine folks at <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a>, where I'm helping them explore and develop new business lines. </p>

	<p>I'm available for project-based consulting engagements. Whether you're a startup looking at your first product or a mature business looking to optimize, I can probably help. Learn more about <a href="/services/">what I offer</a>, or just <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

<h3>What Else</h3>
<p>I enjoy teaching others, which lately has meant some public speaking. I'm presenting on the psychology of design at the upcoming <a href="http://www.webvisionsevent.com/portland/">Webvisions PDX</a>, and spoke about the <a href="/2013/07/01/science-of-empathy/">power of empathy</a> in a well-received lightning talk at <a href="https://twitter.com/ignitedc">Ignite DC</a>.</p>
<p>Founded <a href="http://www.productcampclt.org">ProductCamp CLT</a>, the Charlotte chapter of a global conference series for Product Managers and Product Marketers.</p>
<p>
Member of the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/charlotte/">Code for Charlotte</a> Brigade, the volunteer organization that supports <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a>. </p>

	<h3>Find me online</h3>
	<p>You can find me <a href="http://twitter.com/sutterbomb">on Twitter</a>, where I won't always be behaving, or on <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/suttonchristopher">LinkedIn</a>, where I probably will be. </p>
