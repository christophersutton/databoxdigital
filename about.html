	<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Chris Sutton</strong>. I'm a software product manager and business strategist. I specialize in product optimization using a blend of customer analytics and customer psychology. </p>
	
	<p>By day I'm working with the fine folks at <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a>, where I'm helping them explore and develop new business lines. </p>

	<p>I'm available for project-based consulting engagements. Whether you're a startup looking at your first product or a mature business looking to optimize, I can probably help. Learn more about <a href="/services/">what I offer</a>, or just <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>
