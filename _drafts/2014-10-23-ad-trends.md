monkbent has a new post up comparing google to ibm and mocrosoft of yore. his basic tenent is that Google wont be disrupted, rather it will be eclipsed by a larger market. 

i agree with the central tenet of what is to come, but im unsure of whether gooogle willl wnd up winnign. but i have an issue with terminology. 

he claims native advertisig will win becuase it is brand advertising which is a mich larger soend. but there are generally two types of ads; direct response and brand. and while at the far end of the spectrum there are clear differences, its really a apectrum. 

First, television advertising is not all brand advertising.
