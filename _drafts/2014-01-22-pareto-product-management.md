Product management is no easy job. Defined by negative space. 
I'm going to stealing the phrase from [Aaron Ginn](http://www.aginnt.com/post/73953641639/8-practical-tips-for-growth), but Pareto product management is an extremely powerful mindset.

###The Pareto Principle
I'll give the honors of defining this concept to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle):
> The Pareto principle (also known as the 80â€“20 rule, the law of the vital few, and the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

Most people will have heard of this as the 80/20 rule. It's named after the Italian economist [Vilfredo Pareto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto)

###Feature Development

###A/B Testing & Optimization
The pareto principal is crucial to keep in mind when optimizing your site through A/B tests and multivariate tests. 80% of your optimization gains will come from just a handful of tests. Don't get discouraged when a single test fails to provide a meaningful lift - that's the nature of the game. You need to forecast the failures into your development cycles.

For example, if the 80/20 rule was perfectly accurate and perfectly distributed, that means one in five tests (20%) would provide the vast majority of your gains (80%). If you're not committed to running at least five tests, you risk not realizing a significant gain from the first test or two and giving up on the process. This is particularly true for a mature product that's already had some optimization done.

As a product manager, not only is your job to help identify the top tests to run, but to educate both the execution team and the management team that you have to commit to a testing strategy. If you can only get buy-in for running a single test to "see how it goes", you face the very real risk of of not finding a winner and not trying again for many, many cycles. 

###Usability Testing
There isn't a better source of qualitative product feedback than usability testing. There's also not a better example of the Pareto Principle than in choosing your test participants. 

First, simply conducting usability testing with any regularity will get you major results. When the majority of teams aren't doing anything, that first twenty percent of just getting started will give you a leg up. You can design suboptimal tests and recruit suboptimal users and still come away with significant insights into what's working and what's not. I'm not saying you should run suboptimal tests, just that optimizing them is less important than just getting started. 

Second, you should never have more than five participants per test. That number is straight from the godfather of usablility, [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/), but I've seen it in action myself. Why? Because additional test subjects will yield only marginally better results. The first five will give you 80% of the insights. Additional participants may add some value, but they'd be better served as participants in a new test. 

Nielsen [even ran the data](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) to prove this point:

There are simply diminishing returns to adding more users. Not only will they yield fewer new insights, but your development teams likely won't be able to execute on solutions for those additional, lower-priority items. 

###Roadmaps and Product Planning
Don't spend too much time trying to forecast future release dates and far-away project timelines. Another way to look at this is the distinction between precision and accuracy. In common terms, the accuracy of something is how close your measurement is to the actual true value. The precision

###Finding Advocates
Product evangelism is a crucial aspect of product management in many organizations. You need to have buy-in from leadership to set strategy and get a team or budget. You need the execution team engaged and believing in their mission to have them performing at their peak. Sales and marketing need to agree its a product vision that sells. Customer service needs to believe it'll truly help your customers before they'll bring it up in crucial conversations. 

Throughout the organization, you'll be managing expectations and creating not just buy-in but excitement about the future of your product. They're could be dozens of colleagues that ultimately play a role in the success or failure of your launch, and they all need to be on your side. But getting all of these people on your side can be a lot of work! 

Instead of relying on yourself to convince them all, try to find some advocates. An advocate is anyone willing to go to bat either for you personally or for the vision you're selling. By focusing your time and effort on a few key advocates, you can have them help spread the word and allay any fears or doubts amongst the teams. 

Not only will they lay the groundwork for you in their respective circles, but they can also act as a lookout for potentially difficult conversations. Since you've freed up some time by letting your advocates work the crowd, you'll have more time to gather additional data or validate your ideas more thoroughly in ways that can convince the skeptics. 

###Recursive Nature
One last closing thought. Many people often object to the 80/20 rule on the grounds that that 80% simply isn't good enough. When you frame it as let's do 80%, then move on it the next objective. Sometimes that's the right call, but not always. 

But something to keep in mind is that the 80/20 rule applies infinitely down. When you've gotten 80% there! there's still 20 to go. But you should see that twenty as your new baseline. How can you get 80% of *that* with just 20% of the effort? And again and again until you've reached product nirvana. It's a mindset shift for many who've come to see the remaining work as a slog, the gg after you've picked the low hanging fruit. But coming with that mindset will make you less open, less adaptive, to finding the shorter routes that achieve the goals. If you're expecting a slog and you find one, you won't be looking to change course.
