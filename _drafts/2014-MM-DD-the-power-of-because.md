Imagine you're in line at a Kinkos, where you're waiting to make copies at a self service copy machine. You've waited and waited and just as it's your turn, someone comes up and says 

>Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine?

How do you respond? Do you let them go ahead of you? Now imagine the same scenario, but the person comes up and says 

>Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine, because I'm in a rush?

Do you think that one little phrase - "because I'm in a rush" - would have an impact on how you respond? 

###What the Research Says
Harvard psychologist [Ellen Langer](http://www.ellenlanger.com) designed an experiment that covered that exact scenario. {{end_excerpt}} She found that the requests that were coupled with a reason were far more likely to let the person cut in line.

<table class="table">
<tr>
	<td>No reason</td>
	<td>60% compliance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>With reason</td>
	<td>94% compliance</td>
</tr>
</table>

Just adding a simple reason for why you're making a request is a very powerful motivator when making small requests. But this is fairly intuitive. It makes sense that a request with a reason would be more likely to have a favorable response. 

So here's where things get interesting. Now imagine you're in the same scenario, but instead they come up and say this: 

>Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine because I need to make copies?

If you're reading this and thinking about it rationally, you realize it's bullshit. It's not a real reason at all, and it doesn't even particularly make sense. How do you think you'd respond to this? 

Despite how you think you might respond, there's a really good chance you'd still comply with the request. 

<table class="table">
<tr>
	<td>Bullshit reason</td>
	<td>93% compliance</td>
</tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

The research showed that people are just as likely to comply with a small request coupled with a bullshit reason as they are to comply with a small request and a real reason. Why is this? 

###"Because" is a Trigger Word
The word "because" is a conjunction, used to combine a statement with a cause, or reason. 
!["Because" in grammar](/images/because-grammar.png "Optional title")
We see this pattern countless times every day. Since we see it so often, we've learned to treat "because" as a trigger. It tells us that a reason is about to follow. When the stakes are low, we aren't particularly mindful and don't particularly care what the stated reason is - we simply hear the word "because" and assume there is a valid reason. 

###An Example of How to Use It
Let's say you're designing a product page, and the product comes with a lifetime warranty. You've done your research already and know that this warranty really resonates with customers and potential customers. So you want to get this message in front of everyone.

Maybe you keep it simple:

> We offer a lifetime warranty. 

Or even just:

> Lifetime Warranty Gaurantee

This could definitely work. It's straightforward and direct. But using a powerful trigger word like "because" will immediately validate the statement in the eyes of your users.

> We offer a lifetime warranty because we stand behind our products 100%. 

Keep in mind the actual copy coming after the "because" isn't that important. Users will see the word because and instantly, subconciously, tell themselves a little story. There's a reason they offer the warranty, therefore it must be valid. I can trust them. 

This may not make logical sense, but it really doesn't matter. It resonates emotionally because it's a pattern that's been engrained in us. It's a trigger word that will cause us to assign value - to believe in the statement - and it an be a powerful motivator in writing copy that sells.
