--- <p>My grandmother died last week. She died in the house she lived, the house her husband built. He wasn&rsquo;t a contractor by trade, just a man who built his own house. I, on the other hand, still gloat about the coffee table I once refinished.</p>

<p>And as I think about my fathers father, building a house, or raising a barn or sowing a field, I am soaring 30000 feet above earth. And as I think about my fathers mother, teaching class, rolling gnocchi or leading grace, I tap my thoughts on a three inch slab of glass.</p>

<p>And I think about how quickly things change. Just two generations but a world of difference. </p>

<p>My grandmother had a social network so large we needed 3 days to celebrate her life with everyone she knew. But she wasn&rsquo;t online. She didn&rsquo;t need to be connected because she was. I don&rsquo;t think it has much to do with technology. It&rsquo;s fear and comfort in solitude and luxury. </p>
