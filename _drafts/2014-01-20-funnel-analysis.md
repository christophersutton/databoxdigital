A fair warning - this truly is a beginners guide. The concepts were going to explore won't be new to most, but it's easy to overlook just how many people in the business world arent coming from a deep background in web. 

###The Overview
A conversion funnel is a term to describe the basic process that your users will go through to convert. 

A conversion is the when a visitor completes a predetermined goal. 

A visitor refers to a single person who visits your site. We can track a single person through a browser cookie. Because the cookie is attached to the browser, this means a single person could theoretically be using two browsers, such as Chrome and Internet Explorer, and we wouldn't be able to distinguish that as a single visitor. This happens more than you'd think, buts it generally not prevalent enough to cause serious problems. 

A session or a visit is a set period of time that a visitor is browsing your site. This means a single visitor can and often will have multiple visits over a given time. 

You will have an ultimate goal or conversion event. This is what you want your visitors to do - whether it's to purchase something, subscribe to a mailing list or submit their contact information. This is referred to as the bottom of the funnel. 

You will also likely have multiple steps in the funnel. Sometimes these can be considered a goal in their own right, as you can break your funnel down into smaller steps. 

The goal of creating a funnel is to help you understand what's driving site behavior and how it can be improved. Once you have a funnel in place, you can see specific steps that seem problematic and attempt to address them.

Extending the funnel and dissecting the funnel. When you're just getting started, it's probably useful to stick to the basic flow. But as you're comfortable with the data and making progress on improving it, you likely want to extend the funnel toward your advertising channels, and possibly even post purchase feedback. 

Say you are running a PPC campaign that's bringing in a third of your traffic. If you assume all traffic is created equal, you may be missing out on some crucial information. But if you segment out the organic traffic and only look at your PPC, a different picture may start to emerge. Are more people dropping off on the very first page? Maybe you're not selling well enough for people who haven't heard of you before. By extending the funnel to consider click conversion though, maybe you'll realize that you're targeting visitors who don't make sense. If your PPC campaign is too broad, or the copy is misleading, you'll end up spending for visitors to come to your site that had no chance of converting. This is called unqualified traffic, and can be an expensive problem to have. 

On the other end of the funnel, you may want to extend your analysis to customer satisfaction.
