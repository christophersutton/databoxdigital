Newspapers may be dying, but information services have never been in better shape. 

I had the chance to see YYY do a business development seminar up at [Packard Place] last week, and it was surprisingly helpful. It was basically an hour long pitch for the Charlotte Business Journal - which is just one of 150XX such journals owned by the parent company. But like most things - if the service is useful the pitch doesn't have to be awful.

The newspaper, especially weekly's or lesser known daily's, can actually be a superb source of leads when doing business development.
