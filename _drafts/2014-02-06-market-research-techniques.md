Many product managers these days aren't coming from a business background, they're coming from product development backgrounds like engineering or UX. While this type of background has many advantages in the execution phases of a product lifecycle, it can leave PMs struggling when it comes to more traditional business-oriented tasks like market research.

Let's first start with some definitions. There's a difference between customer development and what I'm referring to as market research. For market research, I'm looking at the size and trajectory of the market, the competitors in the space and adjacent spaces, and the dynamics of the market that are unique or important to consider. Customer development may help uncover some of these things, particularly about market dynamics, but it's only one piece of the puzzle.

If customer development is about validating your assumptions, market research is about coming up with them to begin with.  

##Market Size
Addressable market vs. available market. 
###Research & Consulting Firms
These are some go-to sources for research reports. They'll often release small portions of larger reports for free, otherwise the reports can be pretty expensive. 
IBIS
InfoTrends
Forrester
Gartner

###Trade Associations
Many industries will have a trade association, and these associations will often release data about the state of the industry like overall market size and growth.

###Public Filings
For a mature market, there is likely at least one if not several companies that are publicly traded. These will be a huge source for information, as they're required to release a lot of financials, and they'll typically release a deck of additional information for their quarterly earnings calls. Even if you're looking at a "new market", there's likely adjacent markets that will provide good benchmarking data.

###Web Analytics
similarweb.com is the best free tool I've found for basic traffic and referral data of competitors. 
spyfu.com is a paid tool, but is great at understanding the PPC and SEO market for competitors. 

Understanding PPC spend can also give you indicators of conversion rate - if two competitors are generally the same size and provide the same offering, the one that's spending more is likely to be better converting. The higher the conversion, the more money you're able to bid and still be profitable. 

###Company Size
Knowing the headcount of a given company can help put them in perspective in a competitive landscape. Many companies will list this information in the about section of their website, or on their jobs page. LinkedIn also usually lists an employee count range. 

If there are public companies in the space, you can use this employee count coupled with their revenue numbers to serve as a benchmark for smaller companies. E.g. If public company X earns ~$200,000 per employee, and a smaller competitor Y has ten employees, then company Y probably has revenues around $2M a year.

Another good source for company size is the Inc5000. You won't find everyone on that list, but it's the easiest first step for companies that are listed.
